Three Main Parts:
1. Data Backend (data infrastructure) -- updating raw data from world, cleaning it, and putting it in a format consumable by App Backend
2. App Backend -- app functionality e.g. market fundamentals derivations, etc..
3. App Frontend

#high convinction:
  - growth, inflation, risk premium, real rates --> should exist as a curve in its final output
  - sp500 and sectors need to exist as an index
  - market is highest order --> if we had multiple indices then probably create high level class called world?
  - marke


question:
 - should company exist as a date

 should curve exists only as a single day --> yes

- need to figure out how ill do attribution


market
  - prices
  - fundameantsl



____________

market.date.price #today we are treating sp500 as market price --> this could change but unlikely
market.date.growth.average #one average growth rate for market that day
market.date.inflation.avearage  #one average inflation rate for market that day
market.date.real_rates.average #one average real rate for market that day
market.date.erp #one average erp

market.price.change --> returns change between two dates

market.date.growth #market growth curve for that day
market.date.inflation #market inflation curve for that day
....


index.price
index.date.price
index.date.constituents



market.country
market.currency




market.date.index.growth # return growth curve for certain index on certain day
market.date.inflation # returns inflation




market.growth #latest market growth rate

market.

company.date.price #returns price of company for specific day

1. Data Backend
 - Updates through reoccuring google cloud functions
 - sources of data: each of these should be its own class
    - FRED
    - Web Scraping
    - My own other databases
    - Alpha Vantage
 - each souce class has functions:
    - update data from source
    - save data to specific database
- update will be down at some candence using google cloud functions
- **** still need to figure out how to handle instances where I don't want to update everything or i need to combine sources ****


2. App Backend

classes

 - market
   - real rates
   - inflation
   - risk premium
   - growth


 - company
 - curve -- given set of prices and maturities, can return zeroes, forward rates, etc..(can be used for treasuries, tips, growth, rp, etc..)
 - index -- given set of companies -- returns index mktcap, shares, eps, payout ratio, price, and growth etc.. (can be used for broader index but also sectors)
 -



3. App Frontend -- don't worry for now;
