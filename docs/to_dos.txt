10/30/2021:
-- figure out fundamental data upload
-- decisions: keep free version of alpha vantage -- too much work already done, dont want to go backwards, ill can just run once a week
-- way to limit pulls:
1.) overview data --> only needs to be pulled once
2.) data i need to construct company measures (for now):
 -- stock --> for price
 -- earnings data
 -- balance sheet
 -- adjusted stock for dividneds

 3.) idea -- besides price daily; i can get earnings calendar and only pull data when i need to <-- this is the way to go; this assumes too that earnings and 10Q/K get released the same day

 11/2/2021:
 -- need to make false assumption that earnings and financial reports (income, cash flow, balance sheet all released together --> this is not true; earnings are released first)


-- assume:
--> timeline: earnings, balance sheet, dividneds
--> be smart about which companies to update: only those date > earnings date AND fiscalEnding < past fiscial ending

11/3/2021:
-- learned that alpha vantage has a program that'll remove the 500 day cap (still limits to 5 query per minute) so this works for me!
-- will continue to build this out https://www.alphatournament.com/dashboard/
